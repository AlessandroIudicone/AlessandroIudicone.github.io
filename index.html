			<h2>üìú About me</h2>
			<p>
				I am a software engineer passionate about my work and about IT in general.<br>
				I currently hold the position of DevOps engineer in Aruba and work in a team of 10+ people in which I play a
				role of mid-level responsibility.
			</p>

			<p>
				I spent part of my career in France, where I worked
				for two and a half years as a back-end Java developer at Orange SA in Sophia-Antipolis. During this
				employment, I became interested in some DevOps tools, which is why I later moved into this area.
			</p>

			<p>
				I occasionally work on personal projects in the IT domain (see below) and attend online courses to keep up to date on technologies that interest me. Among my official
				certifications is the OCA Java 8 certification, which I obtained on 28/12/2018.
			</p>

			<p>
				In addition to the professional IT world, I also dedicate myself to IT in a hobbyist mode, performing
				activities ranging from repairing, maintaining and upgrading PCs (both assembling and replacing components
				and software), to creating visual content (video and photo editing, creating business cards and posters).
			</p>

			<p>
				My academic career has been focused on economics, but in the last years of university, I nurtured an
				ever-growing interest in IT.<br>
				Therefore, I combined my university education with training through online courses (MOOCs) on topics
				firstly in the area of data analysis and quantitative analysis (which I used for my theses and research
				at university) and then on programming basics (which made me get closer and more passionate about the world
				of software engineering).

			<h2>üèÜ Accomplishments</h2>

			<p>
				The accomplishments I consider most relevants to me are when I succeed in explaining something to one of
				my colleagues or my peers.
